This project was a group effort, consisting of two major parts: Part A: Database Design and Implementation for a Flight Booking System, and Part B: Classification of Phishing URLs using Machine Learning.

In Part A, I played a leading role in shaping the overall approach and was primarily responsible for the database design.
This included the development of the Entity-Relationship Model, the transformation into a well-structured Relational Schema, and the subsequent implementation using SQL. 
I also contributed significantly to writing and justifying the design choices, as well as running implementation test cases.
Additionally, I assisted in the integration of MongoDB to provide a NoSQL perspective on the system.

My group members, whose names are acknowledged in the report, collaborated on various sections and provided important support throughout.
They contributed to expanding the implementation, documentation, and testing, ensuring the final system was complete and functional.

In Part B, the team collectively worked on the classification of phishing URLs using machine learning techniques.
This included converting the dataset into a database format, performing exploratory data analysis, and proceeding with model selection.
The section also covered dimensionality reduction with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the application of two feature selection methods to optimize model performance.
Tools like WEKA were employed for training and testing, with results documented in the appendix for validation.

Overall, while the projectâ€™s success was the result of group collaboration, my major contributions centered
                    around defining the technical approach, designing and implementing the relational database system in SQL, and ensuring the foundational database aspects of Part A were robust and well-integrated.
